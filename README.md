# Time-Series-and-Forecasting-Final-Project
In this project I analyze and process the Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number in order to evaluate ARIMA and ES model regarding a twelve months forecast metrics against test data. 
The project was done using R.
The PDF of the project 'sunspot_final_project.pdf' can be found in the folder 'output'.

## Objective:

To analyze a real time series for forecasting or other propose. If your interest is in forecasting then  different approaches such as namely smoothing methods (ES). and statistical models (ARIMA models) must be compared. 

## Description:

1. ~~First submit your data set (time series) with a short description  of the data ( plot and acf) and the aim of the analysis - for approval- use link below~~

2. Write a report of your analysis explaining carefully what you have done and why you have done it. Your report should include the following elements.  
        2.1. ~~A discussion of the statistical features of the time series.~~  
        2.2. Analysis of the data. For example if you are forecasting then you must include:  
                * ~~Explanation of transformations and differencing used. You should use a unit-root test as part of the discussion.~~  
                * ~~A description of the methodology used to create a short-list of appropriate ARIMA models and ES models. Include discussion of AIC values as well as results from applying the models to a test-set. consisting of the last 12 months of data provided.~~  
                * ~~Your chosen ARIMA and ES models along with estimation, diagnostics, forecasts and prediction intervals. Diagnostic checking for both models should include ACF/PACF graphs as well as the Ljung-Box test.~~  
                * ~~Comparison of the results from each of your preferred models. Which method do you think gives the better forecasts? Explain with reference to the test-set.~~    
                * ~~Out-of-sample point and 95% prediction intervals for each model for one year past the end of the data provided.~~    
                * ~~Compare your forecasts with the actual numbers. How well did you do?~~  
3. ~~Discuss the benefits and limitations of  your study~~     

## Students must submit

* Written report
* Code to run the analysis
* Data
